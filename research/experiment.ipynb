      "Question:  1. What are the key objectives of Target 12.3 in reducing food waste at retail and consumer levels, and how does it aim to minimize food losses throughout production and supply chains?\n",
      "Answer:  Target 12.3 aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030 and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. The key objectives include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Halving Food Waste**: The target focuses on reducing the amount of food wasted by consumers and retailers, which involves improving awareness and practices related to food consumption and disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reducing Food Losses**: It aims to address food losses that occur during production and supply chains, which can involve enhancing agricultural practices, improving storage and transportation methods, and ensuring better management of food resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Post-Harvest Losses**: The target emphasizes the importance of minimizing losses that occur after harvest, which can include spoilage, damage during handling, and inadequate storage facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the target seeks to create a more sustainable food system by promoting efficient use of resources, reducing environmental impacts, and improving food security.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:  2. What specific actions does Target 12.4 outline to ensure the environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste, and what benefits are anticipated for human health and the environment?\n",
      "Answer:  Target 12.4 outlines the following specific actions to ensure the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes in accordance with agreed international frameworks.\n",
      "2. Significantly reduce the release of chemicals and waste to air, water, and soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The anticipated benefits for human health and the environment include minimizing adverse impacts caused by hazardous chemicals and waste, leading to improved health outcomes for populations and a healthier environment overall.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:  3. How does Target 12.5 propose to significantly reduce waste generation, and what strategies are recommended for prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse?\n",
      "Answer:  Target 12.5 proposes to significantly reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. However, the specific strategies recommended for achieving these goals are not detailed in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies for prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse as outlined in Target 12.5.\n",
      "-------------------\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:  4. What responsibilities does Target 12.6 assign to companies, particularly large and transnational corporations, regarding the adoption of sustainable practices and the incorporation of sustainability information into their reporting?\n",
      "Answer:  Target 12.6 encourages companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle. This implies that these companies are responsible for implementing sustainable methods in their operations and ensuring that their sustainability efforts are transparently communicated in their reports.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:  5. In what ways does Target 12.8 aim to provide individuals with access to relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles that are in harmony with nature?\n",
      "Answer:  Target 12.8 aims to ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature by promoting education and raising awareness about sustainable practices. This includes providing access to information about sustainable consumption and production patterns, encouraging individuals to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors, and fostering a greater understanding of the impact of their choices on the environment. The target emphasizes the importance of integrating sustainability information into public education and outreach efforts, thereby empowering individuals to make informed decisions that contribute to sustainable development.\n",
